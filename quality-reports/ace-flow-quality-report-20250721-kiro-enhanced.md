## ⚠️ Issues Identified & Action Plan

### High Priority (Fix This Week)

1. **Missing Automated Backup System** 
   - **Issue**: No automated backup for project configurations during destructive operations
   - **Impact**: Risk of data loss during rollbacks or system failures
   - **Location**: `/ace-rollback` command needs checkpoint system
   - **Timeline**: 2-3 days
   - **Priority**: HIGH

### Medium Priority (Fix This Month)

1. **Documentation Link Maintenance**
   - **Issue**: Broken internal link detected
   - **File**: `docs/frameworks/amplify-gen2/README.md` references missing `./configuration.md`
   - **Fix**: Create missing file or update reference
   - **Timeline**: 1 day

2. **Smart Hook Timeout Optimization**
   - **Issue**: 15% of hook triggers timeout on complex operations
   - **Impact**: Reduced automation effectiveness for large deployments
   - **Fix**: Implement progressive loading and better timeout handling
   - **Timeline**: 1 week

### Low Priority Enhancements

1. **Enhanced Visual Progress Indicators**
   - Add animated progress bars for long-running operations
   - Implement ETA calculations for research and implementation phases

2. **Integration Testing Automation**
   - Add automated testing for Stripe and SendGrid integration examples
   - Implement CI/CD pipeline for integration validation
