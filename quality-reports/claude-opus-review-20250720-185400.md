# Claude Opus Quality Review Prompt for ACE-Flow

**Comprehensive quality assessment prompt for Claude Opus to thoroughly review the ACE-Flow system and ensure all components work as expected.**

---

## üéØ **Review Context**

You are conducting a comprehensive quality review of **ACE-Flow** - an intelligent workflow system for AWS Amplify Gen 2 development that provides automated project creation, research-driven implementation, and self-learning capabilities.

### **System Purpose**
ACE-Flow eliminates the common problem of AI generating outdated Amplify Gen 1 code by maintaining a curated local documentation library and using research-driven development patterns. It provides 5 core commands for complete project lifecycle management.

### **Critical Success Criteria**
- **100% Amplify Gen 2 compliance** - No Gen 1 patterns anywhere in the system
- **Documentation accuracy** - All examples use current framework versions
- **Command consistency** - All ACE-Flow commands work as documented
- **Production readiness** - All patterns and integrations are production-ready
- **User experience excellence** - Clear, tested end-to-end workflows

## üìö **System Architecture Overview**

### **Core Components**
1. **Local Documentation Library** (`docs/` directory)
   - AWS Amplify Gen 2 documentation (getting-started, data-modeling, authentication)
   - Next.js 14+ App Router documentation (app-router, data-fetching)
   - Architecture patterns (social-platform, e-commerce, content-management, dashboard-analytics, simple-crud)
   - Integration guides (Stripe, SendGrid, etc.)

2. **ACE-Flow Commands** (`.claude/` directory)
   - `/ace-genesis` - Intelligent project creation
   - `/ace-research` - Documentation research with local docs integration
   - `/ace-implement` - Infrastructure-aware implementation
   - `/ace-adopt` - Safe migration of existing projects
   - `/ace-learn` - Self-learning from implementations
   - `/update-docs` - Documentation maintenance
   - `/ace-review` - Quality assurance (this command)

3. **Supporting Systems**
   - Documentation versioning and tracking
   - Quality standards and validation
   - Source attribution and legal compliance

## üîç **Detailed Review Areas**

### **1. CRITICAL: Amplify Gen 1 vs Gen 2 Compliance**

**Primary Objective**: Ensure 100% of code examples use current Amplify Gen 2 patterns.

#### **What to Look For (MUST FIX if found):**

**‚ùå Amplify Gen 1 Patterns (OUTDATED - should NOT appear anywhere):**
```typescript
// WRONG - Gen 1 patterns
import { API, graphqlOperation } from 'aws-amplify';
import { createTodo } from './graphql/mutations';

const newTodo = await API.graphql(graphqlOperation(createTodo, { input: todoData }));

// WRONG - Old auth patterns
import { Auth } from 'aws-amplify';
await Auth.signIn(username, password);

// WRONG - Old storage patterns  
import { Storage } from 'aws-amplify';
await Storage.put('key', file);
```

**‚úÖ Amplify Gen 2 Patterns (CORRECT - should be used everywhere):**
```typescript
// CORRECT - Gen 2 patterns
import { generateClient } from 'aws-amplify/data';
import type { Schema } from '@/amplify/data/resource';

const client = generateClient<Schema>();
const newTodo = await client.models.Todo.create(todoData);

// CORRECT - New auth patterns
import { signIn } from 'aws-amplify/auth';
await signIn({ username, password });

// CORRECT - New storage patterns
import { uploadData } from 'aws-amplify/storage';
await uploadData({ key: 'key', data: file });
```

#### **Specific Files to Check:**
- `docs/frameworks/amplify-gen2/*.md` - All Amplify examples
- `docs/patterns/*.md` - All architecture pattern implementations
- `docs/integrations/*.md` - All integration code examples
- `.claude/*.md` - All command documentation examples

#### **Validation Checklist:**
- [ ] All imports use specific paths (`aws-amplify/data`, `aws-amplify/auth`)
- [ ] All data operations use `client.models.Model.create/update/delete()`
- [ ] All auth operations use individual function imports
- [ ] All storage operations use new `uploadData`/`downloadData` patterns
- [ ] No `graphqlOperation` or `API.graphql` usage anywhere
- [ ] All TypeScript types properly reference `Schema` types

### **2. Documentation Accuracy and Completeness**

#### **Framework Documentation Review:**
**Location**: `docs/frameworks/`
