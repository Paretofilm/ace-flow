## Pattern Selection Algorithm

### Decision Matrix
```python
def select_architecture_pattern(conversation_data: dict) -> str:
    """
    Intelligent pattern selection based on conversation analysis
    """
    indicators = conversation_data["architecture_indicators"]
    complexity_signals = conversation_data["complexity_signals"]
    integration_needs = conversation_data["integration_requirements"]
    
    scoring = {
        "social_platform": calculate_social_score(indicators),
        "e_commerce": calculate_commerce_score(indicators),
        "content_management": calculate_content_score(indicators),
        "dashboard_analytics": calculate_analytics_score(indicators),
        "simple_crud": calculate_crud_score(indicators)
    }
    
    # Weight by complexity and timeline constraints
    for pattern in scoring:
        scoring[pattern] *= complexity_weight(complexity_signals, pattern)
        scoring[pattern] *= timeline_weight(conversation_data["timeline"], pattern)
    
    return max(scoring, key=scoring.get)

def calculate_social_score(indicators: list) -> float:
    social_keywords = ["users", "social", "community", "sharing", "profiles", 
                      "friends", "follow", "like", "comment", "feed"]
    return len(set(indicators) & set(social_keywords)) / len(social_keywords)
```

### Hybrid Pattern Support
```yaml
Hybrid_Patterns:
  "social_commerce":
    base: ["social_platform", "e_commerce"]
    features: ["social_selling", "influencer_marketplace", "group_buying"]
    
  "content_analytics":
    base: ["content_management", "dashboard_analytics"]
    features: ["content_performance", "reader_analytics", "engagement_tracking"]
    
  "community_learning":
    base: ["social_platform", "content_management"]
    features: ["course_creation", "community_discussion", "progress_tracking"]
```

## Pattern Customization Engine

### Dynamic Feature Addition
```python
class PatternCustomizer:
    def customize_pattern(self, base_pattern: str, specific_requirements: dict) -> dict:
        """
        Dynamically customize architecture patterns based on specific needs
        """
        base = self.load_base_pattern(base_pattern)
        
        # Add specific features based on requirements
        if specific_requirements.get("real_time_collaboration"):
            base = self.add_real_time_features(base)
        
        if specific_requirements.get("mobile_app_support"):
            base = self.add_mobile_optimizations(base)
        
        if specific_requirements.get("ai_features"):
            base = self.add_ai_integrations(base)
        
        return base
    
    def add_ai_integrations(self, pattern: dict) -> dict:
        """
        Add AI/ML capabilities to any pattern
        """
        pattern["integrations"].update({
            "ai_services": "AWS Bedrock for LLM features",
            "image_analysis": "AWS Rekognition",
            "text_analysis": "AWS Comprehend",
            "recommendations": "AWS Personalize"
        })
        return pattern
```
