# üìä ACE-Flow Specification Compliance Checker with Steering Context

## Purpose
**ace-spec-check** provides comprehensive analysis of how well your current implementation matches the original project specifications generated during the genesis phase. Enhanced with steering context, this command implements Kiro-style accountability by tracking specification drift, applying project-specific quality standards, and ensuring requirements remain aligned with actual functionality using proven patterns.

## Core Functionality

### Specification Compliance Analysis
```bash
/ace-spec-check                    # Basic compliance check
/ace-spec-check --detailed         # Detailed analysis with deviation breakdown
/ace-spec-check --fix-drift        # Interactive mode to update specs or code
/ace-spec-check --report           # Generate accountability report
/ace-spec-check --tests            # Check test-specification alignment
/ace-spec-check --with-steering     # Enhanced with steering context
```

## üéØ Steering Context Integration

### Active Steering Files
ace-spec-check automatically loads relevant steering context for enhanced compliance checking:

```
üéØ Active Steering Context:
  ‚Ä¢ Quality standards and thresholds (conditional)
  ‚Ä¢ Specification compliance history (conditional)
  ‚Ä¢ Implementation learnings and patterns (conditional)
  Total: 3 steering files loaded

üìä Compliance Intelligence: Project-specific standards applied
```

### How Steering Enhances Compliance Checking

1. **Project-Specific Quality Thresholds**
   - Uses `quality-standards.md` for custom compliance levels
   - Applies domain-specific quality requirements
   - Enforces project-established testing standards

2. **Historical Compliance Context**
   - Leverages past compliance patterns and decisions
   - Applies lessons learned from previous drift resolutions
   - Uses proven approaches for specification management

3. **Implementation Pattern Awareness**
   - Recognizes established implementation patterns
   - Validates against documented architectural decisions
   - Applies context-specific validation rules

### Automatic Learning Capture
Compliance insights are captured back to steering:

```yaml
steering_updates:
  quality-standards.md:
    - Compliance threshold refinements
    - New validation patterns
    - Testing standard improvements
    
  implementation-learnings.md:
    - Specification drift patterns observed
    - Successful resolution approaches
    - Anti-patterns to avoid
    
  domain-expertise.md:
    - Business rule validation insights
    - User story interpretation refinements
    - Acceptance criteria evolution
```

## Command Processing

### Phase 1: Load Original Specifications
```yaml
specification_sources:
  genesis_specs: ".ace-flow/specs/genesis-requirements.json"
  user_stories: ".ace-flow/specs/user-stories.json"
  acceptance_criteria: ".ace-flow/specs/acceptance-criteria.json"
  technical_specs: ".ace-flow/specs/technical-architecture.json"
  implementation_plan: ".ace-flow/specs/implementation-roadmap.json"
```

### Phase 2: Analyze Current Implementation
```yaml
analysis_targets:
  code_structure:
    - "src/**/*.{js,ts,jsx,tsx}"
    - "amplify/**/*.{js,ts,json}"
    - "pages/**/*.{js,ts,jsx,tsx}"
    
  functionality_mapping:
    - API endpoints vs specified features
    - UI components vs user story requirements
    - Data models vs specification schemas
    - Authentication vs security requirements
    - Integration points vs external service specs
    
  test_coverage:
    - Unit tests vs acceptance criteria
    - Integration tests vs user story validation
    - E2E tests vs workflow specifications
```

### Phase 3: Compliance Scoring
```yaml
compliance_metrics:
  overall_score: "0-100% based on requirement fulfillment"
  
  category_scores:
    user_stories: "Percentage of user stories fully implemented"
    acceptance_criteria: "Acceptance criteria met vs total"
    technical_architecture: "Planned architecture vs actual structure"
    security_requirements: "Security specs implemented"
    performance_requirements: "Performance criteria met"
    
  deviation_types:
    missing_features: "Specified but not implemented"
    extra_features: "Implemented but not specified"
    modified_behavior: "Different from original specification"
    incomplete_implementation: "Partially implemented features"
```

### Stakeholder Reporting
```markdown
# Weekly Specification Accountability Report

**Project**: fitness-tracking-app  
**Week Ending**: January 22, 2025  
**Team**: Frontend + Backend + Product

## Executive Summary
- **Overall Compliance**: 87% (Down 2% from last week)
- **New Features Added**: 2 (Premium subscription, Enhanced profiles)
- **Specification Updates Needed**: 3
- **Critical Missing Features**: 1 (Real-time sharing)

## Key Decisions Made:
‚úÖ **Approved**: Premium subscription addition (business requirement)
‚ö†Ô∏è **Pending Review**: Login flow simplification 
‚ùå **Delayed**: Real-time features (technical complexity)

## Next Week Actions:
1. Update specifications for approved changes
2. Plan implementation of real-time features
3. Align team on authentication strategy

## Compliance Trend: üìâ Declining
**Cause**: Scope expansion without specification updates  
**Action**: Schedule specification review meeting
```

## Integration Notes

This command works seamlessly with:
- **ace-genesis**: Loads specifications from genesis phase
- **ace-status**: Shows compliance in project status
- **ace-validate**: Includes compliance in pre-deployment checks
- **ace-implement**: Validates implementation against specs
- **Smart hooks**: Automated compliance monitoring

The ace-spec-check command transforms ACE-Flow from having "good specifications" to having "true Kiro-style accountability" where specifications and implementation remain synchronized throughout the development lifecycle.
