# ACE-Learn: Self-Learning Intelligence System

**Continuously improves ACE-Flow through error tracking, solution validation, and proactive knowledge gathering.**

## Usage

```bash
/ace-learn [learning-mode]
```

Examples:
- `/ace-learn analyze` - Analyze recent errors and solutions
- `/ace-learn update` - Update commands based on learned patterns
- `/ace-learn research` - Refresh documentation knowledge base
- `/ace-learn report` - Generate learning insights report

## Self-Learning Philosophy

ACE-Learn operates on **"continuous intelligence"** principles:

1. **Error Pattern Recognition**: Track failures and successful solutions
2. **Solution Validation**: Measure effectiveness of fixes over time
3. **Proactive Knowledge Updates**: Refresh documentation before it becomes outdated
4. **Community Learning**: Aggregate insights across all ACE-Flow usage
5. **Automated Improvement**: Self-update commands and documentation

## Learning System Architecture

### 1. Error Intelligence Engine

#### Error Context Capture
```yaml
Error_Entry:
  timestamp: "2024-01-15T10:30:00Z"
  command: "/ace-genesis fitness-app"
  phase: "implementation"
  error_type: "amplify_deployment_failure"
  context:
    project_type: "social_platform"
    aws_region: "us-east-1"
    node_version: "18.17.0"
    amplify_version: "2.15.0"
  error_details:
    message: "DynamoDB table creation failed: insufficient permissions"
    stack_trace: "..."
    user_environment: "..."
  
  attempted_solutions:
    - solution: "Updated IAM permissions"
      success: true
      time_to_resolve: "15 minutes"
      validation: "subsequent deployment successful"
    
  learning_impact:
    updated_commands: ["ace-genesis.md", "CLAUDE.md"]
    new_gotchas: ["DynamoDB permissions in newer AWS accounts"]
    prevention_added: true
```

#### Pattern Recognition
```python
def analyze_error_patterns(error_log: list) -> dict:
    """
    Identify recurring issues and successful solution patterns
    """
    patterns = {
        "common_failures": identify_frequent_errors(error_log),
        "solution_effectiveness": measure_solution_success_rates(error_log),
        "environmental_factors": correlate_environment_issues(error_log),
        "timing_patterns": analyze_failure_timing(error_log),
        "prevention_opportunities": identify_preventable_errors(error_log)
    }
    
    return generate_learning_insights(patterns)
```

### 2. Solution Intelligence System

  solution_details:
    steps:
      - "Add DynamoDB full access to IAM role"
      - "Verify CloudFormation permissions"
      - "Restart amplify sandbox deployment"
    
    code_changes:
      - file: "CLAUDE.md"
        section: "AWS Permissions"
        addition: "Ensure DynamoDB full access for newer AWS accounts"
      
      - file: "ace-genesis.md"

        for solution in high_success_solutions:
            if solution["automation_potential"] > 0.8:
                self.add_to_auto_fix_library(solution)
                self.update_command_instructions(solution)
