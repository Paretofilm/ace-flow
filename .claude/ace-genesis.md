# ACE-Genesis: Intelligent Project Creation

**Creates custom AWS Amplify Gen 2 applications through intelligent conversation and architecture decision-making.**

## Prerequisites Check

ACE-Genesis will automatically check your setup and guide you through any missing requirements.

## Usage

```bash
/ace-genesis [initial-idea]
```

Examples:
- `/ace-genesis "I want to build a fitness tracking app"`
- `/ace-genesis "online marketplace for handmade products"`
- `/ace-genesis "team collaboration platform"`

## What This Command Does

1. **Intelligent Interview**: Conducts 7-10 targeted questions to understand your vision:
   - Who are your users and what problem are you solving?
   - What would success look like 6 months after launch?
   - What types of data will your app handle?
   - Do you need real-time features or third-party integrations?

2. **Smart Architecture Selection**: Analyzes your responses using pattern recognition:
   - **Social Platform**: For user-generated content, social features, real-time updates
   - **E-commerce**: For selling products, payments, inventory management
   - **Content Management**: For blogs, documentation, publishing workflows
   - **Dashboard Analytics**: For data visualization, reporting, metrics
   - **Simple CRUD**: For basic data management, task tracking

3. **Solution Preview & Validation**: Shows you the tailored solution before building:
   - Explains why the chosen architecture fits your needs
   - Lists key features with reasoning
   - Provides implementation timeline estimate
   - Allows quick modifications if needed

4. **Custom Project Generation**: Creates tailored architecture and implementation plan:
   - Custom data models for your specific domain
   - Appropriate authentication strategy (basic, social, multi-role)
   - Optimal storage and real-time configuration
   - Production-ready deployment setup

## Implementation Process

ACE-Genesis automatically handles setup verification and workflow enhancement:

### Phase 1: Setup Verification
- **Workflow Check**: Verifies `.github/workflows/*.yml` files exist
- **GitHub App Check**: If no workflows found, guides user to install GitHub App
- **ACE-Flow Integration**: If workflows exist, enhances them with ACE-Flow capabilities

### Phase 2: CLAUDE.md Configuration
- **Check Existing**: Looks for existing CLAUDE.md file
- **Smart Merge**: If found, enhances with ACE-Flow capabilities
- **Template Setup**: If not found, creates ACE-Flow enhanced CLAUDE.md
- **Project Customization**: Updates project-specific sections

### Phase 3: Intelligent Project Creation
```bash
# 1. Genesis conversation (this command)
/ace-genesis "your idea"

# 2. Automatic research phase (triggered automatically)
# - Scrapes 30-100 pages of current AWS Amplify Gen 2 documentation
# - Extracts proven patterns and identifies gotchas
# - Creates comprehensive implementation context

# 3. Implementation with infrastructure awareness
# - Deploys backend with timing awareness (2-5 minutes)
# - Generates types and implements frontend
# - Runs validation loops with auto-fix
# - Results in production-ready application
```

## Architecture Pattern Recognition

The system automatically identifies your project type based on conversation:

### Social Platform Pattern
- **Triggers**: "users", "social", "community", "sharing", "profiles", "friends"
- **Generated**: User authentication with groups, real-time feeds, media storage, social interactions
- **Example Output**: Fitness app with workout sharing, friend connections, progress tracking

### E-commerce Pattern  
- **Triggers**: "sell", "products", "payments", "inventory", "orders", "marketplace"
- **Generated**: Multi-vendor authentication, Stripe integration, product catalogs, order processing
- **Example Output**: Handmade crafts marketplace with seller dashboards, buyer protection

### Content Management Pattern
- **Triggers**: "blog", "content", "articles", "publishing", "cms", "documentation"
- **Generated**: Rich text editing, publishing workflows, SEO optimization, media management
- **Example Output**: Collaborative documentation platform with version control

### Dashboard Analytics Pattern
- **Triggers**: "analytics", "dashboard", "data", "reports", "metrics", "insights"  
- **Generated**: Real-time data visualization, complex queries, interactive charts
- **Example Output**: Business intelligence dashboard with live data streams

### Simple CRUD Pattern
- **Triggers**: "manage", "track", "organize", "simple", "basic", "list"
- **Generated**: Basic forms, data management, simple relationships
- **Example Output**: Task management system with user assignments

## Solution Preview Examples

### Fitness App Example
```
## üéØ Your Tailored Solution Preview

Based on our conversation, I've designed a **Social Platform** for you:

### üèóÔ∏è Architecture: Social Fitness Platform
**Why this pattern?** You mentioned users sharing workouts and social motivation - 
this requires user profiles, content sharing, and real-time social interactions.

### ‚ö° Key Features:
‚Ä¢ User profiles with workout history - Essential for progress tracking
‚Ä¢ Social feed with workout sharing - Drives the motivation you wanted
‚Ä¢ Real-time progress updates - Keeps users engaged and competing
‚Ä¢ Mobile-optimized interface - Critical for gym/outdoor use

### ‚è±Ô∏è Implementation Timeline:
‚Ä¢ **Research Phase**: ~20 minutes
‚Ä¢ **Deployment**: ~4 minutes  
‚Ä¢ **Total**: Working app in ~90 minutes

### üöÄ Ready to proceed?
**'yes'** - Let's build this! (automatic research ‚Üí implementation)
**'modify [aspect]'** - Quick adjustment (e.g., 'modify auth to include social login')
**'explain [feature]'** - Tell me more about a specific feature
```

### Common Modifications
- `modify auth to include social login` ‚Üí Adds Google/Apple sign-in
- `modify to focus more on mobile` ‚Üí Adjusts UI for mobile-first design  
- `modify to be simpler` ‚Üí May shift to Simple CRUD pattern
- `modify to add payments` ‚Üí Adds premium features with Stripe

## Expected Outcome

After validation and confirmation:

‚úÖ **Project Specification**: Complete architecture document with user approval
‚úÖ **Custom Data Models**: Tailored to your specific domain  
‚úÖ **Authentication Strategy**: Validated and appropriate for your user types
‚úÖ **Implementation Plan**: Step-by-step development roadmap
‚úÖ **Research Requirements**: Automated documentation gathering
‚úÖ **Deployment Strategy**: Production-ready AWS Amplify Gen 2 setup

The system automatically proceeds to:
1. Research 30-100 pages of current documentation
2. Generate comprehensive implementation context
3. Deploy infrastructure-aware implementation
4. Result: Working application in <2 hours

## Quality Guarantees

- **>95% Success Rate**: Generated applications work on first deployment
- **Production Ready**: Includes testing, security, performance optimization
- **Real AWS Integration**: Works with actual cloud infrastructure, not toy examples
- **Documentation Driven**: Based on 30-100 pages of current official docs

*This command transforms any idea into a precisely tailored, production-ready AWS Amplify Gen 2 application through intelligent conversation and architecture decision-making.*
