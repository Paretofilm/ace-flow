# üéØ ACE-Flow Steering Management Command

## Purpose
**ace-steering** manages the Kiro-style steering files that provide persistent, project-specific context to enhance ACE-Flow's research, documentation, and implementation capabilities.

## Core Functionality

### Steering File Management
```bash
/ace-steering                          # List all steering files and status
/ace-steering --create [type]          # Create new steering file from template
/ace-steering --edit [file]            # Edit existing steering file
/ace-steering --validate               # Validate all steering files
/ace-steering --sync                   # Synchronize steering context
/ace-steering --analytics              # Show steering usage analytics
```

## Command Processing

### Phase 1: Steering Context Discovery
```yaml
steering_discovery:
  scan_directories:
    - "steering/"
    - ".kiro/steering/"
    - "docs/steering/"
    
  identify_files:
    - research-methodology.md
    - architecture-decisions.md
    - domain-expertise.md
    - quality-standards.md
    - documentation-style.md
    - technical-context.md
    - implementation-learnings.md
    - compliance-requirements.md
    
  analyze_inclusion_modes:
    - always: "Files included in every interaction"
    - conditional: "Files included based on file patterns"
    - manual: "Files included when explicitly referenced"
```

### Phase 2: Steering File Status Assessment
```yaml
status_assessment:
  file_health:
    - last_updated: "Freshness of steering content"
    - inclusion_mode: "How the file is activated"
    - usage_frequency: "How often the file provides context"
    - content_completeness: "How much project-specific content exists"
    
  context_coverage:
    - research_coverage: "Research methodology and priorities"
    - architecture_coverage: "Architectural decisions and context"
    - quality_coverage: "Quality standards and compliance"
    - domain_coverage: "Business and domain knowledge"
```
