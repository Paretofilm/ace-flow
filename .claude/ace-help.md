## Best Practices

### 1. Start with Genesis
Always begin new projects with `/ace-genesis` to ensure proper setup and architecture selection.

### 2. Research Before Implementation
Use `/ace-research` to understand best practices before implementing complex features.

### 3. Monitor Progress
Keep `/ace-status` open in another terminal for real-time updates during long operations.

### 4. Regular Reviews
Run `/ace-review` after major implementations to ensure quality standards.

### 5. Keep Documentation Updated
Use `/update-docs` regularly to maintain accurate project documentation.

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Issue**: "Infrastructure deployment taking too long"
**Solution**: Check `/ace-status` for detailed progress. AWS deployments typically take 2-5 minutes.

**Issue**: "Type generation failed"
**Solution**: Ensure your schema is valid and run `npx amplify generate` manually if needed.

**Issue**: "Command not found"
**Solution**: Ensure you're in an ACE-Flow enabled project with proper `.claude/` directory.

## Getting More Help

For additional assistance:
1. Check the project's CLAUDE.md file
