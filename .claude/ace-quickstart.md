# Select: simple_crud pattern
/ai task-manager
```

#### E-commerce Platform (45 minutes)
```bash
/ag "marketplace for handmade items"
# Select: e_commerce pattern
/ar payments e_commerce
/ai craft-marketplace
```

### 🔧 Common Tasks

#### Check What's Happening
```bash
/as                    # Quick status
/as --detailed         # Full breakdown
/as --monitor          # Live updates
```

#### Get Help on Any Command
```bash
/ah                    # General help
/ah implement          # Specific command
/ah error ACE-001      # Error help
```

#### Migrate Existing Project
```bash
/ace-adopt "existing React app with basic auth"
# or
/aa "legacy e-commerce site"
```

### 💡 Pro Tips

1. **Always start with Genesis**: `/ag` ensures proper architecture
2. **Research before complex features**: `/ar` saves hours of debugging
3. **Keep status open**: Run `/as --monitor` in a separate terminal
4. **Use aliases**: `/ag` is faster than `/ace-genesis`
5. **Trust the process**: Let ACE-Flow handle infrastructure timing

### 🚨 Quick Fixes

| Issue | Command |
|-------|---------|
| "What commands are available?" | `/ah` |
| "How do I start?" | `/ag "your idea"` |
| "Is it still running?" | `/as` |
| "Something went wrong" | `/ah error [CODE]` |
| "I need to add a feature" | `/ar [feature] [pattern]` |

### 📊 Architecture Patterns

| Pattern | Time | Complexity | Use For |
|---------|------|------------|---------|
| `simple_crud` | 15-20m | Low | Basic forms, admin panels |
| `content_management` | 30-40m | Medium | Blogs, wikis, docs |
| `dashboard_analytics` | 45-60m | High | Data viz, reporting |
| `e_commerce` | 45-60m | High | Stores, marketplaces |
| `social_platform` | 60-75m | High | Communities, networks |
