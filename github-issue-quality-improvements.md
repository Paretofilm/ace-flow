**Command Success Rate**: 96.2% (847 executions in 30 days)

## üéØ Issues to Address

### üö® High Priority (Critical - Fix This Week)

#### 1. Missing Automated Backup System
- **Issue**: No automated backup for project configurations during destructive operations
- **Risk**: Data loss during rollbacks or system failures  
- **Location**: `/ace-rollback` command needs checkpoint system
- **Impact**: Production safety concern
- **Estimated Effort**: 2-3 days
- **Acceptance Criteria**:
  - [ ] Implement automatic checkpoints before destructive operations
  - [ ] Add backup validation and integrity checks
  - [ ] Create restore functionality with user confirmation
  - [ ] Add backup cleanup (retain last 10 checkpoints)
  - [ ] Update `/ace-rollback` documentation

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Medium Priority (Fix This Month)

#### 2. Documentation Link Maintenance
- **Issue**: Broken internal link detected during quality scan
- **File**: `docs/frameworks/amplify-gen2/README.md` ‚Üí missing `./configuration.md`
- **Impact**: User navigation disruption
- **Estimated Effort**: 1 day
- **Acceptance Criteria**:
  - [ ] Create missing `configuration.md` file OR update reference
  - [ ] Validate all internal links in documentation
  - [ ] Add link validation to CI/CD pipeline
  - [ ] Document link maintenance process

#### 3. Smart Hook Timeout Optimization
- **Issue**: 15% of hook triggers timeout on complex operations (large deployments)
- **Impact**: Reduced automation effectiveness, user frustration
- **Current Success Rate**: 85% (target: 95%+)
- **Estimated Effort**: 1 week
- **Acceptance Criteria**:
  - [ ] Implement progressive loading for large operations
  - [ ] Add configurable timeout values per hook type
  - [ ] Improve error handling and retry logic
  - [ ] Add hook performance monitoring dashboard
  - [ ] Update hook documentation with timeout guidelines

### üí° Low Priority Enhancements (Future Sprints)

#### 4. Enhanced Visual Progress Indicators
- **Enhancement**: Add animated progress bars and ETA calculations
- **Value**: Improved user experience during long operations
- **Estimated Effort**: 1-2 weeks
- **Acceptance Criteria**:
  - [ ] Add animated progress bars to `/ace-status`
  - [ ] Implement ETA calculations for research and implementation
  - [ ] Add phase-based progress visualization
  - [ ] Include performance metrics display

#### 5. Integration Testing Automation
- **Enhancement**: Automated testing for third-party integrations
- **Value**: Improved reliability and maintenance
- **Estimated Effort**: 2-3 weeks
- **Acceptance Criteria**:
  - [ ] Add automated tests for Stripe integration examples
  - [ ] Add automated tests for SendGrid integration examples
  - [ ] Implement CI/CD pipeline for integration validation
  - [ ] Add integration health monitoring

#### 6. Advanced Hook Configuration System
- **Enhancement**: Custom hook configuration for different project types
- **Value**: Improved automation flexibility and performance
- **Estimated Effort**: 2-3 weeks
- **Acceptance Criteria**:
  - [ ] Add project-type-specific hook configurations
  - [ ] Implement hook performance analytics
  - [ ] Add user-configurable hook settings
  - [ ] Create hook configuration documentation
