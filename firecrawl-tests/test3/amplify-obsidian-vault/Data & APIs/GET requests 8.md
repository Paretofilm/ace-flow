# GET requests

To invoke an endpoint, you need to set input object with required `apiName` option and optional `headers`, `queryParams`, and `body` options. API status code response > 299 are thrown as an `ApiError` instance. The error instance provides `name` and `message` properties parsed from the response.

## GET requests

```ts

async function getItem() ,
        }
    });
    const response = await restOperation.response;
    console.log('GET call succeeded: ', response);
  } catch (error) 
}
```

The `retryStrategy` can be configured with:
- `no-retry`: Single attempt, fails immediately on error
- `jittered-exponential-backoff`: Default strategy that retries with increasing delays, maximum 3 attempts

## Accessing response payload

You can consume the response payload by accessing the `body` property of the response object. Depending on the use case and the content type of the body, you can consume they payload in string, blob, or JSON.

```ts
// ...
const  = await restOperation.response;
// consume as a string:
const str = await body.text();
// OR consume as a blob:
const blob = await body.blob();
// OR consume as a JSON:
const json = await body.json();
```

> **Note**: 

You can not consume the response payload more than once.

## Access HTTP response from errors

The REST API handler may throw an `ApiError` error instance. If the error is caused by an HTTP response with a non-2xx status code, the error instance will provide a `response` property. The `response` property contains following
properties:
* `statusCode`: HTTP status code
* `headers`: HTTP response headers
* `body`: HTTP response body as a string

The following example shows how to access the HTTP response from an `ApiError` instance, so that you can handle the error response from your REST API endpoint:

```ts

try );
  await restOperation.response;
} catch (error)  = error.response;
      console.error(`Received $ error response with payload: $`);
    }
    // Handle API errors not caused by HTTP response.
  }
  // Handle other errors.
}
```
